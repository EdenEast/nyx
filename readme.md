# Nyx

Nyx is my current work in progress port of my current [dots] repo. Since wsl2 came out I am
porting my dotfiles to nix. Currently this configuration works for non nixos systems (like Wsl).

This configuration structure is based off of [David Wood] configuration [veritas]. His configuration
works on both nixos and non nixos systems. It is well structured and easy to understand.
